// What is a Median?
// Median is defined as the value which is present in the middle for a series of values. Note, in order to find the median of an array of integers, we must make sure they are sorted.

// Mathematically, Intuition : 
// The problem requires us to simply implement the mathematical formula programmatically. Hence, we need to make sure that the array is sorted and calculate the answer based on whether n is odd or even.

// Approach : 
// Sort the array in ascending order
// Check whether n is odd or even
// Calculate the median accordingly. Hereâ€™s a quick demonstration of the same

// Output:
// The median of the array is: 4.5

// Time Complexity: O(N*log N), Sorting of array

// Space Complexity: O(1)
