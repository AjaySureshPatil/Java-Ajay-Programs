//static : Static ik keyword.If we declare any method as static, it is known as the static method. 
    // The core advantage of the static method is that there is no need to create an object to invoke the
    //  static method. The main() method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require creating an object 
    //  to invoke the main() method. So, it saves memory.
//main : (method)represents the starting point of the program.
// String args[] is used for command line argument
// System.out.println() is used to print statement. Here, System is a class, out is an object of the 
    //  PrintStream class, println() is a method of the PrintStream class
